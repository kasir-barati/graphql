# Pagination

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Different pagination models enable different client capabilities.
> - For code and implementation you can check my `apps/botprobe-nest` project in [this repo](https://github.com/kasir-barati/graphql-js-ts).

To traverse the relationship between sets of objects. we can have a field that returns a plural type:

```graphql
{
  post {
    id
    title
    comments {
      id
      content
      user {
        id
        username
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Some fields return a list of values.
- Accept `first` and `after` to allow for specifying a specific region of a list.

  ![Slicing or pagination in GraphQL with first as argument](../assets/slicing-pagination.png)

  But this is not gonna cut it when our client needs to paginate. Here are some API designs we can have:

  1. `comments(first:2 offset:2)` returns the next two in the list.
  2. `comments(first:2 after:$commentId)` returns the next two after the last comment we fetched.
  3. `comments(first:2 after:$commentCursor)` returns the next two comments from where the cursor points to.

  [Cursor-based pagination](https://github.com/kasir-barati/nestjs-materials/blob/main/docs/designing-restful-api/pagination.md#cursorBasedPagination) is the one we'll use.

## Cursor-based pagination in GraphQL

How can we send the cursor to the client?

- We obviously do not wanna add it to our `Comment` type.
- It is a property of the `comments`, not of the `post`.

## Relay cursor connections

- A generic specification for how a GraphQL server should expose paginated data.
- A predictable contract between the client & server.
- Might seems a bit complex but that's because it is so generalized.
  - Therefore we'll go through it step by step.
- "Connections" is a feature-rich pagination design pattern.
- [Relay](https://relay.dev/) knows how to work with "Connections" design pattern.

> [!TIP]

> **Lovely specification**:

> To ensure a consistent implementation of this pattern, we can take a loo at the [Relay Cursor Connections Specification](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm).

### Add a new [layer of indirection](../glossary.md#indirectionDefinition)

- Our `comments` field should give us a list of edges.
- An edge has both:

  - A cursor.
  - The underlying node.

- We can also ask for additional information about the connection itself, e.g.:

  - How many comments is written for that post?
  - Is there more connections (comments to fetch)?
  - Etc.

### Why Were Connections Created?

- A very crucial existential question.
- To have a very efficient method of paging (learn more about efficiency [here](https://github.com/kasir-barati/sql/blob/main/docs/select/pagination.md)).
- To have a common nomenclature that is generic enough to encompass everything.

### Designing GraphQL Schema

![Cursor-based connections pagination](../assets/graphql-cursor-based-connections-pagination.png)

- `PostCommentsConnection`:

  - An "object".
  - Fields:

    - `edges`.

      <details>
        <summary>Fields inside it</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>node</code> contains the actual comment's data.
            <br />
            <b>Cannot be a list!</b>
          </li>
          <li><code>cursor</code> is the cursor to that "node".</li>
          <li>Can have additional fields related to the edge</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

    - `pageInfo`:

      <details>
        <summary>Fields inside it</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><code>startCursor</code> is the first cursor of the "page".</li>
          <li><code>endCursor</code> is the last cursor of the "page".</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

    - Additional info related to the connection

- `PostCommentEdge`:
  - An actual entity in our graph.
- `commentsConnection`: you can perform forward pagination, backward pagination, **or both**.

  - **Forward pagination**:
    - `first`:
      - Mandatory.
      - Slices the data, i.e., returns that many comments.
    - `after`:
      - Mandatory.
      - Paginates through the data, i.e., returns comments after that cursor.
  - **Backward pagination**:
    - `last`:
      - Required.
      - A non-negative integer.
    - `before`:
      - Required.
      - Returns the nodes before that cursor.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Sort edges the same way, in both, forward pagination and backward pagination. I.e.,
>
> - `after`: the edge closest to `cursor` must **come first**.
> - `before`: the edge closest to `cursor` must **come last**.

> [!TIP]
>
> In graph theory, an _edge_/_connection_ can have properties of its own which act effectively as metadata;
>
> ```graphql
> enum CommentSentiment {
>   NEUTRAL
>   POSITIVE
>   NEGATIVE
> }
> type PostCommentEdge {
>   cursor: String!
>   node: Comment
>   sentiment: CommentSentiment
> }
> ```
>
> **Note**: most tools treat the edge type as boilerplate. But we are not gonna do that, we add data that belongs to the edge to the `edge` type.

### 3rd-party libs

- In Prisma we have libraries such as [prisma-relay-cursor-connection](https://github.com/devoxa/prisma-relay-cursor-connection).
- Or ORM agnostic libraries such as [nestjs-graphql-connection](https://github.com/equalogic/nestjs-graphql-connection).
